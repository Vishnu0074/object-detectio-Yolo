Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model and OpenCV in Python. It uses the lightweight and accurate ultralytics library for fast inference and easy integration.

Features
Real-time object detection from webcam or video file

Bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores

Works with YOLOv8 pretrained models (n, s, m, l, x)

Simple and fast Python implementation
